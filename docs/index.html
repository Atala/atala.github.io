As a developer I have worked with both marketing and support teams and helped to translate their business needs into technical requirements. After startup, I organize intermediary mileage meetings to assert the project is on track. My main goal is to <span class=underlined>deliver</span> the software that will fits your needs.<p class=margin-bottom-md>On the frontend side, I can integrate any design you like in <span class=underlined>HTML/CSS</span> and to enhance the user's interactions with <span class=underlined>Javascript</span>. I can also build single page web-apps, with <span class=underlined>Backbone</span> and <span class=underlined>React</span>.<p class=margin-bottom-md>For backend stuff, I use mostly <span class=underlined>Python</span>, as it is versatile and have a very complete ecosystem. I am familiar with both <span class=underlined>Flask</span> and <span class=underlined>Django</span>. I know some bits of PHP, as I have developed several simple websites with it. I am also experienced in <span class=underlined>Wordpress</span> and <span class=underlined>Prestashop</span> development.<p class=margin-bottom-md>I have <span class=underlined>deployed</span>, <span class=underlined>maintained</span> and <span class=underlined>monitored</span> complex systems. They were involving <span class=underlined>SQL databases</span> (PostreSQL, MySQL), <span class=underlined>No-SQL stores</span> (Redis, MongoDB) and <span class=underlined>message brokers</span> (RabbitMQ). I can find the operating systems and cloud solution that will fit your case as I have experience with several of them (<span class=underlined>Heroku</span>, <span class=underlined>AWS</span>, <span class=underlined>OVH</span>).</div></div><section class="banner banner--projects"><h1 class="h1 h1--banner">Projects</h1></section><footer class=footer></footer></div><script src=scripts/main.min.js></script>
